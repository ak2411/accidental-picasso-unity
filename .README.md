# Accidental Picasso
Open to Interpretation is a passthrough, hands-only, multiplayer game where players compete to make sculptural masterpieces out of next-to-nothing. Whether they end up with a Picasso or a pre-school scribble, one thing's for sure: it'll guarantee lots of laughter and banter.

## Inspiration
Constraints inspire creativity. When you don't have infinite shades of blue, or ten types of brushes, and limited time - how will you recreate a highly detailed, realistic object? This was the inspiration for how the game encourages fun conversation between friends. Some games that inspired me were Drawful 2, Pictionary, Secret Hitler (because you have to bluff), and Minecraft's build.

## What it does
Open to Interpretation is a 2-4 person multiplayer game with multiple rounds. In each round, players get 2 minutes and a realistic still life object that they have to recreate using only 10 fixed colors, 4 types of shapes (cube, cone, cylinder, and sphere), and their hands (no controllers!). At the end of each round, players try their best to explain their work and score each other. The player with the highest total points wins. 

The game is in passthrough so players can sit down, use their table, or even sip some wine as they catch up with friends and unleash their creative juices.

## How I built it
I built it for the Quest 2 and 3 using Unity and Meta's Passthrough API, Avatars, and Interaction SDK. I used Normcore as the networking solution to support the multiplayer system including syncing the game state, shapes being created and manipulated, platform height, player avatars, player positions and voice.

## Challenges I ran into
Testing, debugging, and
